        <p>
          Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it
          would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching,
          whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding,
          or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other
          like-minded people.
        </p>

        <p>
          So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer
          and get out into the great outdoors!

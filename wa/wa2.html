    <p>Me in Venice a couple years ago</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>A bit about myself :)</h3>

    <p>My name is Pietro Maran, but <strong>Pit</strong> works just fine; my pronouns are <em>he/him</em>. I am an exchange student from Bocconi University, Italy. 
    <p>I am a senior, hopefully graduating duiring this summer. Here my major is Business Analytics, but in my home university I am majoring in both Economics and Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I am interested in AI and the uncountable number of applications it has in the industry, reason for which I am starting a Master in AI at Bocconi University, in september.</p>
    <p>Not sure about it being by favourite YouTube video, but surely it means a lot to me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX-AC4fridI&t=17s">my first Hooked Tournament</a>, in 2022. </p>

    <h3>My goals for Web</h3>
    <p>I hope to learn basics and some advanced techniques of web development, as well as to become proficient in HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

        <time datetime="1810-08-10">10 August 1810</time> -
        <time datetime="1861-06-06">6 June 1861</time>), generally known as the
        <strong>Count of Cavour</strong> (/kə'vʊər/ kə-VOOR; Italian:
        <em>Conte di Cavour</em> ['konte di ka'vur]) or simply
        <strong>Cavour</strong>, was an Italian politician, statesman,
        businessman, economist, and noble, and a leading figure in the movement
        towards Italian unification. He was one of the leaders of the Historical
        Right and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1852, a
        position he maintained (except for a six-month resignation) until his
        death, throughout the Second Italian War of Independence and Giuseppe
        Garibaldi's campaigns to unite Italy. After the declaration of a united
        Kingdom of Italy, Cavour took office as the first Prime Minister of
        Italy; he died after only three months in office and did not live to see
        the Roman Question solved through the complete unification of the
        country after the Capture of Rome in 1870.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cavour put forth several economic reforms in his native region of
        Piedmont, at that time part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, in his earlier
        years and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being
        elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the
        Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies
        through a union of centre-left and centre-right politicians. After a
        large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in
        1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way
        through the Crimean War, the Second Italian War of Independence, and
        Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand, managing to manoeuvre Piedmont
        diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a
        nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been
        before he came to power.
      </p>
      <p>
        English historian Denis Mack Smith says Cavour was the most successful
        parliamentarian in Italian history, but he was not especially
        democratic. Cavour was often dictatorial, ignored his ministerial
        colleagues and parliament, and interfered in parliamentary elections. He
        also practised trasformismo and other policies which were carried over
        into post-Risorgimento Italy

      <p>
        Cavour was born in Turin during Napoleonic rule, into a family which had
        acquired estates during the French occupation. He was the second of two
        sons of Michele Giuseppe Francesco Antonio Benso, 4th Marquess of Cavour
        and Count of Isolabella and Leri, Lord of Corveglia, Dusino, Mondonio,
        Ottiglio and Ponticelli, Co-Lord of Castagnole, Cellarengo and Menabi,
        Cereaglio, Chieri, San Salvatore Monferrato, Santena and Valfenera, 1st
        Baron of the French Empire (1781-1850), and his wife (1805) Adélaïde
        (Adèle) Suzanne, Marchioness of Sellon (1780-1846), herself of French
        origin. His godparents were Napoleon's sister Pauline, and her husband,
        Prince Camillo Borghese, after whom Camillo was named.
      </p>
      <p>
        Camillo and his older brother Gustavo were initially educated at home.
        He was sent to the Turin Military Academy when he was only ten years
        old. In July 1824 he was named a page to Charles Albert, the King of
        Piedmont (1831-1849). Cavour frequently ran afoul of the authorities in
        the academy, as he was too headstrong to deal with the rigid military
        discipline. He was once forced to live three days on bread and water
        because he had been caught with books that the academy had banned. He
        was found to be apt at the mathematical disciplines, and was therefore
        enlisted in the Engineer Corps in the Royal Sardinian Army in 1827.
        While in the army, he studied the English language as well as the works
        of Jeremy Bentham and Benjamin Constant, developing liberal tendencies
        which made him suspect to police forces at the time. He resigned his
        commission in the army in November 1831, both because of boredom with
        military life and because of his dislike of the reactionary policies of
        King Charles Albert. He administered the family estate at Grinzane, some
        forty kilometres outside the capital, serving as mayor there from 1832
        to the revolutionary upheaval of 1848.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cavour then lived for a time in Switzerland, with his relatives in
        Geneva. He then travelled to Paris where he was impressed by
        parliamentary debates, especially those of François Guizot and Adolphe
        Thiers, confirming his devotion to a political career. He next went to
        London, where he was much more disappointed by British politics, and
        toured the country, visiting Oxford, Liverpool, Birmingham, Chester,
        Nottingham, and Manchester. A quick tour through the Netherlands,
        Germany, and Switzerland (the German part and the Lake Geneva area)
        eventually landed him back in Turin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cavour believed that economic progress had to precede political change,
        and stressed the advantages of railroad construction in the peninsula.
        He was a strong supporter of transportation by steam engine, sponsoring
        the building of many railroads and canals. Between 1838 and 1842 Cavour
        began several initiatives in attempts to solve economic problems in his
        area. He experimented with different agricultural techniques on his
        estate, such as growing sugar beets, and was one of the first Italian
        landowners to use chemical fertilizers. He also founded the Piedmontese
        Agricultural Society. In his spare time, he again travelled extensively,
        mostly in France and the United Kingdom.

      <p>
        The first apparently liberal moves of Pope Pius IX and the Revolutions
        of 1848 spawned a new movement of Italian liberalism, allowing Cavour to
        enter the political arena, no longer in fear of the police. He then gave
        a speech in front of numerous journalists in favour of a constitution
        for Piedmont, which was eventually granted. Cavour, unlike several other
        political thinkers, was not at first offered a position in the new
        Chamber of Deputies, as he was still a somewhat suspicious character to
        the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cavour never planned for the establishment of a united country, and even
        later during his premiership, his objective was to expand Piedmont with
        the annexation of Lombardy and Venetia, rather than a unified Italy. For
        example, during the conservative period, he gained a reputation as a
        non-revolutionary progressive. He was a poor public speaker. Cavour then
        lost the next election, while the Piedmontese army was destroyed at the
        Battle of Novara, leading Charles Albert to abdicate, passing the throne
        to his son, Victor Emmanuel II.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cavour was then brought back into Parliament by the voters, where he was
        much more successful. His knowledge of European markets and modern
        economics earned him the positions of Minister of Agriculture, Minister
        of Commerce, and Minister of the Navy in 1850. Cavour soon came to
        dominate the cabinet of Prime Minister Massimo d'Azeglio. Cavour united
        the Right Center and the Left Center in the chamber to show dominance
        there as well. In 1851, Cavour gained a Cabinet promotion to Minister of
        Finance by working against his colleague from inside the Cabinet in a
        somewhat disreputable takeover, although this was to Piedmont's
        advantage because of his many economic reforms. It allowed Cavour to
        begin his railway expansion program, giving Piedmont 800 kilometres of
        track by the year 1860, one-third of the railways in Italy at the time.
        He took the lead in legislation weakening the powers of the Church to
        own land, control the schools and supervise marriage laws. When the
        bishops protested, they were punished or exiled, making Cavour the hero
        of liberal anticlerical elements across Italy.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Minister_of_Piedmont-Sardinia">Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia</h3>
      <p>
        Cavour formed a coalition with Urbano Rattazzi known as the Connubio
        ("marriage"), uniting the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and
        brought about the fall of the d'Azeglio cabinet in November 1852. The
        King reluctantly accepted Cavour as prime minister, the most
        conservative possible choice, but their relationship was never an easy
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cavour was generally liberal and believed in free trade, freedom of
        opinion, and secular rule, but he was an enemy of republicans and
        revolutionaries, whom he feared as disorganized radicals who would upset
        the social order. Cavour dominated debate in Parliament but is
        criticized for the controversial methods he used while Prime Minister,
        including excessive use of emergency powers, employing friends, bribing
        some newspapers while suppressing others, and rigging elections, though
        these were fairly common practices for the time. The national debt
        soared by a factor of six because of his heavy spending on modernizing
        projects, especially railways, and building up the army and the Royal
        Sardinian Navy. When he became Prime Minister Piedmont had just suffered
        a major defeat by Austria, but when he died, Victor Emmanuel II ruled a
        state five times as large, which dominated Italy and ranked among
        Europe's great powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The allied powers of Britain and France asked Piedmont to enter the
        Crimean War, partially to encourage Austria to enter, which it would not
        do unless it was certain that Piedmontese troops were not available to
        attack Austrian positions in Italy. Cavour, who hoped that the allies
        would support Piedmont's expansion in Italy, agreed as soon as his
        colleagues' support would allow and entered the war on 10 January 1855.
        This was too late to truly distinguish themselves militarily, but the
        18,000-man contingent earned Piedmont a position at the Congress of
        Paris that ended the war.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 1858, the Italian Felice Orsini's attempted assassination of
        Napoleon III paradoxically opened an avenue of diplomacy between France
        and Piedmont. While in jail awaiting trial, Orsini wrote a public letter
        to the Emperor of the French, ending with, "Remember that, so long as
        Italy is not independent, the peace of Europe and Your Majesty is but an
        empty dream... Set my country free, and the blessings of twenty-five
        million people will follow you everywhere and forever." Orsini was still
        executed, but Napoleon III began to explore the possibility of a joint
        operation with Piedmont against Austria. Cavour and Napoleon met in July
        1858 at Plombières-les-Bains, and the two agreed that Piedmont would
        attempt to provoke war with the Duchy of Modena, obliging Austria to
        enter, and France would then aid Piedmont. In return, Cavour reluctantly
        agreed to cede Savoy (the seat of the Piedmontese royal family) and the
        County of Nice to France, and also arranged a royal marriage between
        Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy and Prince Napoléon-Jérôme Bonaparte,
        surprisingly without Victor Emmanuel's consent. In the same year, Cavour
        sent his cousin, the famous beauty, photographic artist, and secret
        agent Virginia Oldoïni, to further the interests of Italian unification
        with the emperor by whatever means possible, and by all accounts she
        succeeded, famously becoming the mistress of Napoleon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both France and Piedmont began to prepare for war, but diplomatic
        support diminished rapidly. Napoleon III quickly soured on the plot, and
        Britain, Prussia, and Russia proposed an international congress, with
        one likely goal the disarmament of Piedmont. Piedmont was saved by
        Austria's sending an ultimatum on 23 April, demanding that Piedmont
        disarm itself, thus casting Austria as an aggressor. France mobilised
        and slowly began to enter Italy, but Piedmont needed to defend itself
        for a short period. Fortunately, rainstorms and Austrian indecision
        under Ferenc Gyulay gave time for France to arrive in force.
      </p>
      <p>
        The battles of Magenta and Solferino left Franco-Piedmontese forces in
        control of Lombardy, but the Austrians remained confident of defending
        their "fortress quadrilateral" area, with four fortresses in Verona,
        Legnago, Peschiera, and Mantua. These defences, the horrors of the
        Battle of Solferino, the possibility of Prussian entry into the war, and
        the potential for an over-strong Piedmontese state convinced Napoleon to
        sign a separate peace with Austria in the Armistice of Villafranca on 11
        July 1859, ending the Second Italian War of Independence. Victor
        Emmanuel accepted the peace, but Cavour was so infuriated after reading
        the terms of the treaty that he tendered his resignation. He soon
        regained his optimism, however, as several of the terms, such as the
        restoration to power of the rulers of Tuscany and Modena, and the
        establishment of an Italian Confederation including Austria, were not
        actually carried out.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora succeeded to Cavour's post and insisted on
      following the treaty terms, even sending a letter to Tuscany asking that
      they restore their Grand Duke. Bettino Ricasoli, virtual dictator of
      Tuscany at the time, wrote about this appeal to his brother, saying: "Tell
      General La Marmora that I have torn his letter into a thousand pieces."
      France continued direct talks with Piedmont on the destiny of the central
      Italian states, all of whose provisional governments supported unification
      with Piedmont but were restrained by the treaty, which called for the
      restoration of their old rulers.
      <p></p>
      Cavour had retired to his estate at Leri, out of politics but concerned
      about the King's alliance with Garibaldi's revolutionaries and his desire
      to renew the war with Austria without allied support. When the weak La
      Marmora cabinet resigned, Victor Emmanuel was reluctant to have Cavour as
      premier again due both to their quarrel over the Armistice of Villafranca
      and Cavour's success in preventing the king from marrying his mistress
      after the queen's death. But Cavour was sent for on 20 January 1860.
      <p>
        Garibaldi was furious that his birthplace, Nice, had been ceded to
        France, and wished to recapture the city, but a popular insurrection in
        Palermo on 4 April 1860 diverted him southward. He requested a brigade
        of Piedmontese to take Sicily, but Cavour refused. So instead, Garibaldi
        raised a force of a thousand (I Mille) redshirt volunteers. They landed
        at Marsala in Sicily on 11 May and won the battles of Calatafimi and
        Milazzo, gaining control of Sicily. Cavour attempted to annex Sicily to
        Piedmont, but Garibaldi and his comrade Francesco Crispi would not allow
        it.

      <p>
        Cavour persuaded Victor Emmanuel to write a letter to Garibaldi,
        requesting that he not invade the mainland; the letter was indeed sent,
        but the King secretly wished Garibaldi to invade. He wrote another
        letter asking him to go ahead, but this was apparently never sent.
        Cavour meanwhile attempted to stir up a liberal revolution in Naples,
        but the populace was unreceptive. Garibaldi invaded, attempting to reach
        Naples quickly before Cavour found a way to stop him. On 7 September he
        entered Naples, at that time the largest city in Italy, and unilaterally
        declared Victor Emmanuel the King of Italy. Garibaldi was now military
        dictator of southern Italy and Sicily, and he imposed the Piedmontese
        constitution but publicly demanded that Cavour be removed, which
        alienated him slightly from Victor Emmanuel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Garibaldi was unwilling to stop at this point, and planned an immediate
        invasion of the Papal States. Cavour feared France in that case would
        declare war to defend the Pope and successfully stopped Garibaldi from
        initiating his attack. Garibaldi had been weakened by the Battle of the
        Volturno, so Cavour quickly invaded the Papal regions of Umbria and
        Marche. This linked the territories conquered by Piedmont with those
        taken by Garibaldi. The King met with Garibaldi, who handed over control
        of southern Italy and Sicily, thus uniting Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between Cavour and Garibaldi was always fractious:
        Cavour likened Garibaldi to "a savage" while Garibaldi memorably called
        Cavour "a low intriguer".
      </p>
      <h3 id="Prime_Minister_of_Italy">Prime Minister of Italy</h3>
      <p>
        In 1861, Victor Emmanuel II declared the Kingdom of Italy, making Cavour
        Prime Minister of Italy. Cavour had many difficult issues to consider,
        including how to create a national military, which legal institutions
        should be retained in what locations, and especially the future of Rome.
        Most Italians thought Rome must be the capital of a united Italy, but
        this conflicted with the temporal power of the Pope and also the
        independence of the Church. Cavour believed that Rome should remain the
        seat of "a free church in a free state", which would maintain its
        independence but give up temporal power. These issues would become known
        as the "Roman Question". Still Austrian Venetia was also a problem.
        Cavour recognized that Venice must be an integral part of Italy but
        refused to take a stance on how to achieve it, saying "Will the
        deliverance of Venice come by arms or diplomacy? I do not know. It is
        the secret of Providence." A motion approving of his foreign policy
        passed by a huge majority, basically only opposed by left-wing and
        right-wing extremist groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating Italy was no easy task, but ruling it proved a worse strain on
        the Prime Minister. In 1861, at the peak of his career, months of long
        days coupled with insomnia and constant worry took their toll on Cavour.
        He fell ill, presumably of malaria, and to make matters worse insisted
        upon being bled. His regular doctor would have refused, but he was not
        available; so Cavour was bled several times until it was nearly
        impossible to draw any blood from him. He was buried in Santena, near
        Turin.

        After his death, Italy would gain Venice in 1866 in the course of the
        Third Italian War of Independence, connected to the Austro-Prussian War.
        The Capture of Rome completed the unification of Italy (aside from
        Trentino and Trieste) in 1870.

        Today, many Italian cities, including Turin, Trieste, Rome, Florence,
        and Naples, have important streets, squares, piazzas, and metro stations
        named after Cavour, as well as Mazzini and Garibaldi. The clipper ship,
        Camille Cavour, the battleship Conte di Cavour, which fought both in
        World War I and World War II, and the new Marina Militare aircraft
        carrier Cavour is also named in his honour.

        In 1865, the Collegio dei Nobili, the oldest high school in Turin
        (founded 1568), and among the oldest and most prominent ones in Italy,
        was renamed the Liceo Ginnasio statale "Camillo Benso di Cavour" (Liceo
        classico Cavour).

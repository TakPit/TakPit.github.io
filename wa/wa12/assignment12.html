        In my extension I changed the Triva API into one generating event
        happened on a specific date, where the year has to be guessed by the
        user. I used API Ninjas, which returns an event and the year in which it
        happened. The endpoint requires a year as a parameter, so at every
        request a random number is generated so that the final endpoint is
        `https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/historicalevents?year=${randomYear}`. The
        original text includes both the date and the event, and I used the date
        as the answer, while removing it from the the sentence displayed. Then
        the user has to input the guess and submit it by clicking the "Submit
        your guess" button. If the guess is correct, the answer is displayed,
        otherwise the user is invited to either try again or look at the answer
        clicking the button "Show me the answer!". I changed the styling to
        mimic the one of my CSS project. I also implemented a media query to
        make the app responsive to changes in width.

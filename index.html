    <p>When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake
      of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit
      and his solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his
      heart changed, and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spoke to it thus:
      You great star! What would your happiness be, had you not those for
      whom you shine?
      For ten years have you climbed here to my cave: you would have wearied of your light and of the journey, had it not been for me, my eagle,
      and my serpent.
      But we waited for you every morning, took from you your overflow,
      and blessed you for it.
      Behold. I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that has gathered too
      much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.
      I would rather give away and distribute, until the wise among men
      once more find joy in their folly, and the poor in their riches.
      Therefore must I descend into the deep: as you do in the evening, when
      you go behind the sea, and give light also to the underworld, you exuberant star!
      Like you I have to go down, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
      Bless me, then, you tranquil eye, that can look on even the greatest
      happiness without envy!
      Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
      from it, and carry everywhere the reflection of your happiness!
      Behold. This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is going to be a man again.
      Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
